I am an Assistant Professor of Natural Language Processing in <a href="http://ixa.si.ehu.es/" style="color:#248a95">IXA Group</a>, part of the HiTZ Centre of the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU.<br><br>

My current research focuses on creating resources and evaluation procedures for under-resourced languages and scenarios, including multimodal LLMs. Previously, I worked extensively on cross-lingual methods, weak supervision, multi-task learning, domain adaptation, as well as sentiment and emotion analysis.<br><br>

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/ltg/" style="color:#248a95">Language Technology Group</a> at the University of Oslo, where I worked on creating sentiment resources and models for Norwegian (<a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/sant/index.html" style="color:#248a95">SANT project</a>). Before that, I was a PhD student at <a href="https://www.upf.edu/" style="color:#248a95">Pompeu Fabra University</a> in Barcelona, working on cross-lingual sentiment analysis for under-resourced languages. During my PhD, I also spent a year at the University of Stuttgart on a research stay funded by the <a href="https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/" style="color:#248a95">IMS</a>.
