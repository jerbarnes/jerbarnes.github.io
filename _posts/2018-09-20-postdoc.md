Starting in October, I'll be working on the [<u>SANT project</u>](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/sant/index.html) with the [<u>Language Technology Group</u>](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/ltg/) at the University of Oslo. We will be working on sentiment analysis approaches and resources for Norwegian, as well as more general state-of-the-art approaches to sentiment.
