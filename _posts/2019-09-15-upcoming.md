I'll be at [SEPLN 2019](http://hitz.eus/sepln2019/) in Bilbao and [NoDaLiDa 2019](https://nodalida2019.org/) in Turku, presenting joint work with Lilja Øvrelid and Erik Velldal on multi-task learning for sentiment, as well as my former Master's student Àlex R. Atrio, who will be presenting our work on the effect of word order on cross-lingual sentiment models. If you're around, feel free to get in contact!
