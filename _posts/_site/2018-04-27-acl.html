<hr />

<p>Iâ€™m really excited to announce that the ong paper that I wrote in conjunction with Roman Klinger
and Sabine Schulte im Walde was accepted at ACL 2018. We establish a joint embedding projection
and sentiment training method which performs well with as few as 1000 pairs of word translations.</p>

<p>The approach allows us to easily perform sentiment analysis in under-resourced languages and effectively
alleviates the data bottleneck.</p>
