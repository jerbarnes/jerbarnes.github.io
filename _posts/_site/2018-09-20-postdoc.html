<p>Starting in October, Iâ€™ll be working on the <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/sant/index.html"><u>SANT project</u></a> with the <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/ltg/"><u>Language Technology Group</u></a> at the University of Oslo. We will be working on sentiment analysis approaches and resources for Norwegian, as well as more general state-of-the-art approaches to sentiment.</p>
