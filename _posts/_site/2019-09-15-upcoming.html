<p>I’ll be at <a href="http://hitz.eus/sepln2019/">SEPLN 2019</a> in Bilbao and <a href="https://nodalida2019.org/">NoDaLiDa 2019</a> in Turku, presenting joint work with Lilja Øvrelid and Erik Velldal on multi-task learning for sentiment, as well as my former Master’s student Àlex R. Atrio, who will be presenting our work on the effect of word order on cross-lingual sentiment models. If you’re around, feel free to get in contact!</p>
