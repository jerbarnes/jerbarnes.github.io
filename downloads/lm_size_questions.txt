Evolution of Transformer-based Models


1. What is the biggest LM we have these days?

2. How much data is used to train it?

3. Besides bias, which we've already mentioned, can you imagine any problems with training a model this size?

4. How much more data do we need to make new models better?

5. If the only way to create awesome NLP is by pretraining on terrabytes of text, what happens to languages that don't have this?

6. Which part of the NLP do you think has the greatest carbon footprint?
    a) Training a NLP pipeline (with a BiLSTM, for example)
    b) hyperparameter tuning for the pipeline
    c) Training a large transformer
    d) neural architecture search on a large transformer

7. Would you think that hyperparameter tuning for a BiLSTM has more or less carbon footprint than:
    a) travelling by plane from New York to San Francisco
    b) an average human in one year
    c) an average American in one year
    d) the full lifetime of a car, including fuel

8. In the last 6 years, the amount of compute used to train the largest LMs has increased:
    a) 30x
    b) 3000x
    c) 300,000x
    d) 3,000,000x

9. If you want to post-hoc reduce the size of a giant LM, can you think of any ways to do it?
